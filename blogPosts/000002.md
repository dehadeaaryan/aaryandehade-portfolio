Thanks for following my blog!

I have recently started updating my [website](https://www.adehade.tech/new/) to make it easier to navigate.

I have been extremely busy this semester with 6 classes and 3 jobs so I never got the time to add some elements to the website that I wanted to last year. 

The upcoming blogs will describe the changes in more detail.
