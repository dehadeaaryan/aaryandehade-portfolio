Winter Break!

---

I just completed the Fall 2022 semester with a GPA of 3.833. My Cumulative GPA has now risen to 3.801. I believe that I could have done better. 

The Updates to the site are noticable now. There are several new animations which make the site feel smoother. I even added a section for my Resume with multiple options to open it. 

Future additions will include a skills section and a refined navigation. The Landing page also needs some changes and will be worked on after every other important element is polished. There will also be a timeline of my life in the near future, possible an animated one. 

Other projects I have started include "Nowlist" and "TCUUtils". I began work on Nowlist a couple of months ago but the team took a break for exams. It was supposed to be a Thanksgiving Break Project. I will post the new Schedule on Github Tomorrow. TCUUtils is a website with important tools to be used by TCU Students. Some of these tools are currently missing and others add more functionality to existing tools. 

Since my Program of study focusses more on the backend of creating applications, I have decided to choose personal projects that will include more frontend work.

Blog posts will now be uploaded at least twice every month.
