Good News!
I applied to the Resident Assistant (RA) position this semster and received an offer letter on Friday. I am delighted and very excited to be working in a Freshman Hall again. 

I also applied to several internship positions but have not heard back yet. I hope to receive more information on that by the end of this week.

The first month of classes was extremely busy and I have not had much time for myself. 

Computer Organization is pretty difficult, especially since the questions asked on the exams are almost entirely about remembering the structure of components like the Decoder. Other classes are easy enough. Linear algebra is a bit confusing, but I believe that I can still do well in that class. The Exploring Math Pathways class has helped me connect with professors and resources that can be useful during my time at university. Intermediate Composition and Understanding the Earth are easier than I thought they would be, and my professor for English is extremely helpful (Abbott). Programming Language Concepts is an easy class as well. 

I expect to get something around a 3.5 GPA this semester, but I hope that I can do better than that. I still have half a semester to do better, and I will.
